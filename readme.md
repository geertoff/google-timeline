# Google Timeline project
This is a school project from my Bachelor program Geo Media & Design (currently Applied Geo-Information Science). The aim of the project was to make a map that visualises Google Location History data in a different way than 'Google Timeline'. I have used my own location data for a certain period to work on this project. 

All tools that have been used or this projet are open source.
